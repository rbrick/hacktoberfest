# I WANT A FREE T-SHIRT
Are my intentions really selfish? Probably. But I am admitting my intent to get a free
shirt so am I really the bad guy in all this? Yes. Yes I am. But I acknowledge that.

I am pretty sure that makes things better.

When does the t-shirt get here? What is it made of? I am hoping like 60/40 cotton-polyester. 
That is comfortable.
